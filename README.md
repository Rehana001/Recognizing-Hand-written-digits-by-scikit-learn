# Recognizing-Hand-written-digits-by-scikit-learn

##what is Hand written recognition ?
Handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents. Think about for example , the ZIP code of letters at the post office and automation needed to recognize digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in order to sort mail automatically and efficiently.
Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR(Optical Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten texts or pages of printed books , for general electronic document in which each character is well defined.
But the problem of handwriting recognition goes farther back in time more precisely to the early 20th century (1920’s) when Emanuel Goldberg(1881–1970) began his studies regarding this issue and suggested that statistical approach would be an optimal choice.

##Hypothesis
The hypothesis involves predicting numeric values and then reading and interpreting an image that uses an handwritten font. so in this case you will have estimator with the task of learning through a fit( ) function and once it has reached the degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid). it will produce a prediction with the predict( ) function, coding is done on python notebook.
